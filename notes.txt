*SPAs(single-page applications) are not crawlable, and that is because the HTML
is rendered via javascript(angularJS for example), the only information
available to search engines is the information delivered by the server, and so
since search engines do not execute javascript, only the non-templated HTML
will be available to crawlers.

*the MEAN stack stands for Mongodb, Express.js, AngularJS, node.js.

*the MEAN stack's flexibility allows for the implementation of different
architectures each serving a particular set of needs, a best practice is to
build a uniform internal API which will be shared by all of the different
architectures, this will streamline maintainability as it will not require
building different API integrations to the database.

*design/planning steps:
  1) write static mockup pages to figure out the needed data and user-journey
  2) move the fake data to a database
  3) build a REST API connecting the application to the database (data-driven)
  4) finishing the product (authentication, application logic etc...).
